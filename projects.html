		<span id="curtainText" style="display: none;">
		<p>
			&emsp; August 2019 to July 2020
			<br>&emsp; Supervisor: Dr Swapnil A Lokhande, Assistant Professor, Indian Institute of Information Technology Vadodara, India.
				<br>&emsp; &emsp; Studied the graph burning problem. We showed that graph burning is NP-Complete on interval graphs, permutation graphs and disc graphs. As corollary, we have that burning of trees, chordal graphs, path forests, planar graphs, bipartite graphs, spider graphs, forests is NP-Complete. For these corollaries, results are present in the literature prior to our work.
				<br>&emsp; &emsp; Articles published: <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-67899-9_6"><u>Burning Grids and Intervals</u></a>.
				<br>&emsp; &emsp; This study was conducted as part of my MTech dissertation.

			&emsp; March 2014 to July 2016
			<br>&emsp; Supervisor: Dr Nirmalya Samantha, Convener, Time Table Committee.
			<br>&emsp; 2 members.
				<br>&emsp; &emsp; Intent: To make and store time table of the college departments. Using the software, a person will be able to monitor or make changes to the time table where required.
				<br>&emsp; &emsp; Advantage: Avoids overlapping in case of rooms and teachers. Views occupancy of classes, faculties, and rooms at any instant during or after the development of the time table. Generates pdf of the same.
