<p>Welcome! I am a Graduate Student at Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University. I also serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant with the department. My research interests are distributed systems, graph theory, theoretical computer science, discrete mathematics. I am also serving as a member of the Graduate Teaching Assistant Program Advisory Group with the Graduate School, Michigan State University.

<p>As part of my doctoral research, we developed a theory that describes the necessary and sufficient properties of parallel processing algorithms that make them tolerant to asynchrony. In addition, we developed asynchrony-tolerant algorithms for several problems, and also showed for various existing algorithms that they are tolerant to asynchrony.

<p>As part of my master's research, we wrote several NP-Completeness proofs.

<p>During my undergrad, I dealt with several projects in embedded systems and software development. Our projects encompass solutions to problems from various domains. I organized and conducted several workshops on embedded systems and software development.

<p>My master's and doctoral research combined have produced several results where we improve an existing algorithm. Specifically, among other results, we show for several existing systems that 
<br>&emsp;&emsp; (1) an algorithm would work the same with fewer assumtions (e.g., not needing a scheduler), or
<br>&emsp;&emsp; (2) an algorithm would work better as it is (e.g. converging in fewer rounds), or
<br>&emsp;&emsp; (3) a problem can be solved in lesser resources' requirement (e.g., not needing to produce additional data structure)
<br> than originally assumed.

<p>I am a poet, painter, engineer, electrician, carpenter, architect, mason, and a very curious mathematician and computer scientist.

<p>My h-index is 5 (I expect it to increase), and ha-index is 75 (I expect it to remain the same) :) .

<p>My advisor: <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~sandeep/"><u>Professor Sandeep S Kulkarni</u></a>.
